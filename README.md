# GeoGrafix-DICOM-Visualiser
A two-week assignment project for SC40103: Scientific Data Visualization course.

This assignment aims to explore the intersection of medical imaging, data visualisation, and software development, creating a DICOM Image Visualiser that displays DICOM image series and its diagnostics along with allowing users to make modifications to the 3D volume reconstructed from the images.
